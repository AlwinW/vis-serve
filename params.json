  "body": "### Project Overview\r\nWhat makes tennis stars like Roger Federer and Serena Williams such effective servers? How can we use graphics to _see_ what is special about great servers and great serves? The aim of this project is to develop effective approaches to visualise the characteristics of serves using serve trajectory data of elite tennis athletes.\r\n\r\n### Project Goals\r\nThe student who takes on this project will use graphical tools in R (ggplot2, rplotly, plot3D, etc.) to propose methods to visually summarise the shape, speed, and location of single serves and serve clusters. The student will work with ball trajectory data from the Australian Open gathered from Hawk-Eye technologies. At the end of the project period, the student will submit a report, written in R markdown, that will describe their proposed visualisation methods and provide illustrative examples.\r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\nThis project is ideally suited for a student who is a proficient R programmer and has experience using the ggplot2 package or equivalent.\r\n\r\n### Supervisors\r\nThe project will be supervised by Professor Di Cook (@dicook) from Monash University and Stephanie Kovalchik (@skoval), a Research Fellow at Victoria University and tennis data scientist at Tennis Australia.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nFor inquiries and questions, please contact <dicook@monash.edu> or <stephanie.kovalchik@vu.edu.au>.\r\n",
