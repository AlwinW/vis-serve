# Introduction
## Goal
  - create realistic summaries of serves that
    > can be interpreted by TV viewers
    > can be used for statistical analysis
  - display characteristic of serves such as
    > position (x, y, z)
    > duration (t)
    > speed (initial v, change in v due to surface)
    > curvature (side spin, top spin, wind effects)
    > strategy (single serve, serve clusters)
## Current Methods
  - landing position of all the serves
  - top-down paths of all the serves
    > Not really informative yeh?
## Visualising Higher Dimensional Data 
  - good and bad methods
    > chernoff faces is bad
    > parallel coordinates can be bad too
  - for 2D images e.g. top down
    > at most 4 variables 
      e.g. x, y, v, clustering
      e.g. x, y, frequency, spin
  - for 3D images 
    > could add more but is much harder to interpret
# Shape
  ## Entire serve plot
  - no point in plotting the entire serve
  - classify the data into bins and colour by a variable
    > e.g. height, but not very useful
    > e.g. speed, but nothing obvious
    > e.g. serve type (hextri), more information but harder to interpret
      * gaps between hexigons, etc
  - remove part of the lines and show landing position instead
    > e.g. split landing position coloured by serve number
    > e.g. contour no limits
    > e.g. contour with service box limits
# Speed
  ## Grouped by type
    > e.g. density coloured by scorer name and factored by server and serve number
  ## Grouped by cluster locations
    > e.g. hexagonal bins with the average speed
    > e.g. overlay aces on contour plot
# Spin
  ## Magnus effect
    > model
    > predictions vs actual
  ## Change in direction before/after bounce
    > plot a distribution
  ## Methods for visualising spin
    > circle around a ball
    > axis vectors in 3D
